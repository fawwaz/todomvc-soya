# Soya TodoMVC Example • [Soya](https://github.com/traveloka/soya)

> Soya uses React, Webpack and Redux to help speed up web front-end engineering efforts. Soya aims to:
> * Make it easier for front-end engineers to create and share UI components, as easy Java engineers import classes!
> * Reuse components on any layer of abstraction, just the view, the domain logic, or the entire component - along with its context.
> * Removes the need to deal with HTML, CSS, JS and static file dependencies manually.
> * Easier to code by running the same view code on server and client side.

>Eventually the final objective is to make the cost of web UI prototyping as small as possible, making iterative development of front-end much more viable.
